- Simulated error responses for testing (`404 Not Found`, `429 Too Many Requests`, `500 Internal Server Error`).
- Has sample routes for **login, register and logout**. They are not actual authentication functionalities, but simple API for practice.
- Simple and fast API for quick integration into projects.

- **Posts:** `/posts` (all posts), `/posts/{id}` (specific post)

- **Error Simulations:**
  - `/404` - Simulates a 404 Not Found error.
  - `/429` - Simulates a 429 Too Many Requests error.
  - `/500` - Simulates a 500 Internal Server Error.

## Authentication Endpoints

- **Login:** `/login/` (Requires `email` and `password` in request body)
- **Register:** `/register/` (Requires `username`, `email`, `password`, `confirmPassword`)

## Usage

To use the API, send requests to the appropriate endpoints using any HTTP client like **Postman**, **cURL**, or **Axios**.

Example `GET` request:

```sh

```

You can also test APIs using **Postman and Thunder Client** if you do not own _Linux_
